			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
			Nick has graduated from Columbus State Community College with an Associates of Applied 
			Science in Software Development. During which he specialized in Game Development and is currently 
			working towards a Bachelor Degree in Software Development at Franklin 
			University. Nick currently about 12 classes away from competing his degree. 
			He attends part time as of right now due to working full time, and managing 
			his company on the side, AfroDuck Studios LLC (ADS).
			</p>
			<p>
			Back in 2017 him and his friend Kwesi began a quest to build their own video 
			game and company, ADS. Starting at the end of 2019, Nick took 
			leadership of the development and programming for the project becoming Programming Lead and has 
			been working in this role since. Daily tasks include developing the 
			pipeline for the programming team, evaluating code to optimize, developing 
			systems and tools for the project, and communicating with all teams.
			As a Founder, he initiates some Executive work and manage timelines for company goals.
			</p>
			<p>
			Nick has some experience working in JavaScript, Python, SQL, Assembly, and XML 
			but is mostly excelled in C++ and C#. He has worked on various other projects 
			in and out of classes, but does not currently have access to the repositories. 
			In his GitHub, there is one project he helped build a prototype for 
			called Challenge Accepted. This app was meant to be a way for people to 
			overcome their social anxiety by completing social tasks to level up.
